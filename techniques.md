### work values
* breaks with self-awareness questions
* my lessons 
* order in my notes
* using my brain to calculate stuff
    * remember numbers, spelling and terminology
    * calculate what you can (offset in `alloca`)
* stubbornness
    * detect work loops and try a new perspective
* the challenge itself

### finding directions / ideas
**All directions are valid**, even if they doesn't add up. **Try** to validate the most easy ones first.
<sup> stack spraying in `alloca` with sleep! and `dragon` with 127 as the upper boundary.</sup>
* what do you want & **need**? with no restriction how could you get it?
* sum the hints & abilities to give you the most probable direction

### Work flow
1. understand the challenge
	**focus on the relative content (rev)**, read about tech in it
2. find hints and sum them to theories
	(internet, tools, description)
3. define your vulnerabilities (`otp`) - reading the code (`otp`) / checking input points (`dragon`)
    * a vulnerability can be merely an unchecked condition (`otp fread fwrite fclose`).
4. sort & define **all** of your abilities (different types of input), **test them `remotely` and locally**
    * first try to work with the ability without understanding it. if there is no escape, understand the black box.
5. analyze in depth an idea, **run wild** with your ideas (`brainfuck`)
6. define the problem and it's causes (`fix`, `otp - traping the signal`). 
    * **Check** why the problem happens (`crypto1`).
    * take a minute to find other solutions. (`brainfuck`)
7. implement the exploit in parts and `test` each. 
    For testing the concept you can use constant values for a specific case. `crypto1`


### learning
1. go through writeups
2. write the *right* thinking flow & write conclusions
3. what did I spend the most time on?
