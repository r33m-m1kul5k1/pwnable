### finding directions / ideas
* ask yourself what do you want, and what do you need?
* sum the hints to give you the most probable direction
* what do I have? and how can I use it with my ability?
* what my ability gives me? (list all different stuff - say jumps to different locations in memory)

### Work flow
1. understand the challenge
	**focus on the relative content (rev)**, and run & debug, read about tech in it
2. find hints and sum them to theories
	(internet, tools, description) **redefine your ability (`gdb`) and what works**
3. define the most general problem and it's causes (`fix`). 
4. list ideas to solve it (**priority**)
	sometimes changing the problem it self is the solution
5. go through the ideas in priority of their likelihood.
6. if the direction seems too complicated or impossible *move* to another idea. and **sort** the list. otherwise go to step 2.

### learning
1. go through writeups
2. write the *right* thinking flow & write conclusions

### General tips
* to warm up your brain, try to challenge it in the challenge.
	* remember numbers, spelling and terminology
* detect work loops, and take a rest, ask yourself how do you feel?
* take constant breaks.
